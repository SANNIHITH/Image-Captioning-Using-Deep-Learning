# Image-Captioning
• Implemented an image captioning model which provides a natural language description of an image.

• The model is made up of a convolutional neural network whose features are passed through a recurrent neural network to generate
sentence descriptions.

• The program was written in python using the Tensorflow library and trained on the MSCOCO dataset which has around 80,000 images
and their descriptions.

• The captioning model was trained on an Nvidia Quadro GPU and managed to produce natural looking descriptions on unseen images
with a BLEU score of 22.5.

•This is done in collaboration with the facelessmanx(my teammate in the semester project).
